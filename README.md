# PyChromix
The real work done here is thanks to smblott-github
https://github.com/smblott-github/chromix

chromix allows command line access to Chrome's developer console.

The idea behind PyChromix is simply creating Python Objects for Chrome windows and tabs (and possibly more such as downloads/ bookmarks). While there are a number of libraries that can be used for some degree of chrome automation, none can be anywhere near as robust and plugging into the chrome console, with the benefit of being cross-platform

Parts of the code are a bit ugly, but if you like the idea I could certainly use help

I could really use help effectively integrating javascript injection

Please feel free to send along any questions/ comments about what I could do to make this more accessible to others
